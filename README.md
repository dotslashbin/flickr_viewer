## Flikr Viewer
This is a simple application that simply displays a series of images from Flickr's public API feed. It may also search feeds based using keywords to match image tags. 

Please note that this is a non-production grade application. I simply followed what was requiered, as I did not have the luxury of time to spend for this test. I would estimate the total work was about 4 hours, since I've been juggling this with baby sitting amongst other responsibilities. 

## Requirements
- Browser ( preferrably Chrome )
- docker
- docker-compose

## How to run it
1. Make sure that you have no other applications using port 9000 and 4200. (I've configured these ports to be used in this application).
